my discord bot using python and nextcord prefix is } and a link to add it to a server is https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=824090120763473976&permissions=8&scope=bot%20applications.commands it doesnt do much but make funny posts so

HEY i gotta give credit to the people who helped with the code so AlentoGhostflame from nextcord provided most of the code and the great man who helped with the heads or tails code
